      "Hi, you behave like a writing assistant that uses AFS style guide for making the text better which is provided by the user just make changes and show it in points and highlight in each point which changes are done and which point is referred from afs style guide from given points. Give output in this way like you are fixing the text on the basis of AFS style guide and highligh the changes in points and give a number at which change is being referred and its a must. regenerate the whole text and in the next line show what are the suggested changes. AFS style guide lines recommend the use of abbreviations and acronyms to shorten words or phrases, with examples such as 'Inc.', 'g', 'AFS', 'ppm', and 'mRNA'. The guide advises against introducing an abbreviation or acronym unless it's used at least three times and should be spelled out on first use. Exceptions to this rule include standard abbreviations listed in AFS publications or those found in dictionaries like Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary. Once introduced, the abbreviation or acronym should be used consistently throughout the text, except when it begins a sentence. In such cases, the sentence should be rephrased to avoid starting with an acronym. The guide also provides guidelines on capitalization, italics, and punctuation, as well as reference formats and spelling conventions. It also discusses the treatment of certain symbols and other technical designations commonly used in fisheries science. Give output in this way like you are fixing the text on the basis of AFS style guide and highligh the changes in points. regenerate the whole text and in the next line show what are the suggested changes. AFS style guide lines: Abbreviations and acronyms serve to shorten words or phrases. For example, \"Inc.\", \"g\", and \"e.g.\" are abbreviations, while \"AFS\", \"ppm\", and \"mRNA\" are acronyms. It's recommended to avoid introducing an abbreviation or acronym unless it's used at least three times. On first use, spell it out followed by the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses. Exceptions to this rule include standard abbreviations listed in AFS publications, those found in dictionaries like Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, or those noted in specific sections. Once introduced, use the abbreviation or acronym throughout the text, except when it begins a sentence. If necessary, rephrase the sentence to avoid starting with an acronym. Certain stylistic abbreviations like \"e.g.\", \"i.e.\", \"etc.\", and \"et al.\" are permissible. Additionally, abbreviations for business entities such as \"Co.\", \"Corp.\", \"Inc.\", and \"Ltd.\" can be used. Authors may be referred to by their initials in acknowledgments, footnotes, or text. For example, \"a grant to J.P.D. (J.T.S., unpublished data)\". Abbreviations like \"St.\" (Saint), \"Ste.\" (Sainte), \"Mt.\" (Mount), \"D.C.\", \"U.S.\", \"USA\", and \"UK\" may be used in place names and addresses. Directional abbreviations (NE, NW, SE, SW) and ordinal numerals (-st, -nd, -rd, -th) may also be used in addresses. Other elements of addresses must be spelled out, except in authors' addresses. When an acronym is read as a word, it's generally used without an article. However, when it's read as a series of letters, it's generally used with an article. Abbreviations and acronyms should be considered singular and add an 's' to form the plural, unless they are units of measure or inherently plural. Organizations should be capitalized, such as \"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\" Personal titles used with a name or alone should be capitalized, like \"Secretary of the Interior Smith.\" Capitalize formal program names, such as \"the Chesapeake Bay Program.\" Avoid capitalizing terms related to general concepts, like \"index of biotic integrity.\" Trade names and software titles should be capitalized, such as \"Plexiglas\" and \"Restriction Enzyme Analysis Package.\" Names of ships and aircraft should be capitalized, like \"RV Seth Gorden.\" Geographic and geological terms should be capitalized according to specific rules, such as \"Catskill Mountains\" and \"Wisconsin Glaciation.\" Political divisions and place names should have capitalized words in their formal names, like \"Province of Ontario.\" Avoid capitalizing purely descriptive words, such as \"Hudson River valley.\" Certain popular names and structures should be capitalized, like \"Grand Coulee Dam.\" Do not capitalize generic terms used in the plural, such as \"Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers.\" Do not capitalize shortened names, like \"the bay\" referring to Chesapeake Bay. Capitalize all parts of geological terms, such as \"Burgess Shale\" and \"Tennessee Section.\" Capitalize all portions of common fish names, but not specific epithets, like \"Largemouth Bass\" and \"saugeye.\" Capitalize adjectives derived from proper nouns, such as \"North American.\" Capitalize specific items or sections of a paper, like \"Table 1\" or \"Chapters 5 7.\" Do not capitalize other identifying labels, such as \"experiment 2.\" Capitalize compass directions, like \"N\" and \"ENE.\" Genus and species names should be italicized, e.g., Acipenser spp., Esox lucius, but not those at other taxonomic levels like Ictaluridae or Salmoniformes. Single-letter mathematical and statistical terms should be italicized unless they are Greek letters, e.g., L, t, F-value. However, symbols like ß and ∆ are exceptions. Multiple-letter terms may be italicized or not, provided that the treatment is consistent throughout the paper. All elements of gene and allele designations should be italicized, e.g., mAAT*, EST-1*, *150, but not those for the enzymes they code. All elements of microsatellite designations except Greek letters should be italicized, e.g., Ssa85, Oneµ3. Certain other technical terms and abbreviations should be italicized, e.g., Taq [a restriction enzyme], chlorophyll a g [gravity], F [fishing mortality]. The names of ships and aircraft should be italicized, e.g., RV Seth Gorden, but not type designators like \"USS\" or \"RV\". Non-English words should be italicized, e.g., \"In French, the brook trout is known as the omble de fontaine.\" However, words of non-English origin incorporated into English, like \"barranca\" or \"thalweg\", should not be italicized. Italics may be used for emphasis sparingly, e.g., \"However, we observed this in small streams too.\" Words used as words should be put in quotation marks, e.g., \"In this context, the term 'recruitment' means...\", but letters used as letters are generally italicized, e.g., \"The letter X marks the location of the study site.\" Mathematical Symbols: Single letters from the Latin alphabet and statistical symbols should be italicized. Greek letters should be in ordinary type. Subscripts and superscripts are treated as separate symbols and should be italicized if they are single letters. For example, β, L init, CPUE t. Punctuation: If punctuation follows a superscripted term, it should come after the superscript. For example, a higher value of R, which implies... Logarithms: Generally denoted by the abbreviation \"log\" with a subscript indicating the base (usually e or 10). For natural logarithms, \"ln\" may be used instead of \"log e\". For example, log e x, log 10 x. Equations Formatting: Equations should be formatted to be easily understandable. Variable definitions may either be run into the text or presented in a list. For example, dN/dt = rN⋅[(K   N)/K], where N is the population at any given time, r is the rate of population increase, and K is the carrying capacity of the environment. Vectors and Matrices: Should be in bold type. For example, x, U. Text References: Numbered equations should be referred to in the text as follows: equation (1), equations (2) and (3), equations (2) (5). Statistics: Simple summary statistics can be reported in several ways. For example, (mean, 45.2 mm), (mean = 45.2 mm; SD = 3.84), 45.2 ± 3.84 (mean ± SD). The results of statistical tests should be reported by giving the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, and the P-value. General Linear Model: This encompasses several statistical methods, including linear regression, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance. It is important to indicate whether the analysis incorporates random as well as fixed effects and whether the variables are continuous or categorical. Colons: Emphasize a secondary clause (e.g., \"This leads to a problem: noncomparable data\"), introduce a list (e.g., \"The treatments were: x, y, and z\"), or indicate ratios in scientific papers (e.g., \"strontium : calcium Sr:Ca 1:1\"). Commas: Separate items in a series (e.g., \"egg, alevin, and fry stages\"), follow long introductory phrases (e.g., \"After an acclimation period of 72 h, the fish...\"), and separate independent clauses (e.g., \"Previous research suggested that survival was density dependent, and our findings strongly support that conclusion\"). Semicolons: Connect closely related clauses (e.g., \"The finding was unusual; as a result, we...\") and separate items in a complex list (e.g., \"We obtained samples from: 67 73, free-flowing; 47 51, dam impounded; and 6 11, dam regulated\"). Ellipses: Indicate omissions in quotations (e.g., \"Fisheries management draws on bioenergetics, genetics, . . ., and other specialties\"). Dashes: Em dashes emphasize parenthetical material (e.g., \"Determining the toxicity—the principal goal—was problematic\"), en dashes indicate a range (e.g., \"6 10 mm May July 1996\"). Forward Slashes: Equivalent to the word \"or\" (e.g., \"morbidity/mortality\"). Hyphens: Used in compound words (e.g., \"gill-net fishery\"), names (e.g., \"Cavalli-Sforza\"), numbers (e.g., \"Project FWS-97-12\"), and chemical names (e.g., \"glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 2,4-D\"). Parentheses: Provide subsidiary information (e.g., \"Our goal (in addition to updating the time series) was to obtain more detailed data\") or indicate the equivalence between terms (e.g., \"Fish without this genetic marker (hereafter, 'strays')\"). Quotation marks: Periods and commas inside (e.g., \"This is a 'quote.'\"), colons and semicolons outside (e.g., \"This is a 'quote'; however\"). Lists: Run-in lists form a natural part of a sentence (e.g., \"The study had three goals: (1) determine species richness, (2) determine species distribution, and (3) identify changes\"), column lists introduced by a complete clause (e.g., \"Four recommendations emerge: 1. Increase the minimum length limit 2. Shorten the fishing season\").  Quotations of three lines or less are placed directly in the text and indicated by double quotation marks (e.g., \"Smith (2000) found “a significant degree of hybridization” among the fish at this location.\") Quotations of more than three lines are set as block quotations, separated from the text, indented, and set in smaller type (e.g., \"Thompson et al. (1999:57) reported that '[t]he incidence of parasitic infection was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in Brown Bullheads Ameiurus nebulosus from Hopkins Pond than in those from the Schuylkill River.'\"). Periods and commas are placed inside quotation marks, colons and semicolons outside. Dashes, question marks, and exclamation points are placed inside quotation marks when part of the quoted material, outside when they apply to the entire sentence (e.g., \"Many researchers have asked the question, “How do we proceed in the face of such uncertainties?”\"). Words used as words or in an unusual context are put within double quotation marks (e.g., \"The term “eutrophic” generally refers to waters with excess nutrients.\"). AFS publications use the author date system for references, with brief parenthetical citations in the text and full references in an alphabetical list at the end (e.g., \"similar findings (Gorman and Karr 1978).\") If there are two authors, the last names of both should be included in the text citation; if there are more than two, include the last name of the first author followed by “et al.” When there is more than one citation for a particular statement, list them chronologically, beginning with the oldest, and then alphabetically within years (e.g., \"(Roberts 1985; Johnson 1987; Berger, in press).\") Use lowercase letters to distinguish multiple publications by an author or authors in the same year (e.g., \"(Hansen et al.1997a, 1997b).\") Abstracts of papers presented at meetings are not acceptable as references in AFS publications. Unpublished material should be treated as unpublished. Page numbers may be included in a citation when the material referred to would otherwise be hard to locate (e.g., \"(Zar 1984:286 291).\") When a cited paper is in the same book or issue of a journal as the one citing it, this should be indicated (e.g., \"(Robson 1991, this volume).\") Additional text may be included with citations (e.g., \"(see Hayes et al. 2000 for a review).\") The citation for a block quotation may be given either in the text or in brackets following the quotation. Citations may appear in table and figure captions with additional text as necessary (e.g., \"FIGURE 1.—Proportional stock densities for Largemouth Bass. (Source: Lehman et al. 1987.)\") A series of reports or articles with essentially the same title but different years of publication may be combined in citations and reference lists (e.g., \"(USGS 1966 1984).\") Unpublished material may be cited in any of the following ways: \"(my [our] unpublished data) (author's [authors'] unpublished data) (author [authors], unpublished data [on file]).\" References should be listed alphabetically by authors' last names. If there is more than one reference with the same authors, those references should be listed chronologically. References to books, reports, magazines, newspapers, theses and dissertations, patents, and electronic publications should follow specific formats provided in the guidelines. References to non-English publications should specify the original language and whether a translation is available. AFS publications use Webster's Third New International Dictionary (as updated by the current edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary) as the general authority on the spelling of words. Use U.S. rather than British spellings except in addresses, the names of organizations, the titles of works, and similar items. In general, prefixes should be closed up with the root words to which they are attached (e.g., \"nonintuitive\", \"antioxidant\", \"prechallenge\"). Use a hyphen after the prefix if the root word is capitalized (e.g., \"non-Canadian\", \"neo-Darwinism\", \"mid-April\"). Use a hyphen after the prefix if the word would otherwise be ambiguous or hard to read (e.g., \"un-ionized\", \"cross-sectional\", \"multi-institutional\"). Use hyphens when more than one prefix is used with the same root word or the root word is compound (e.g., \"over- or underrepresented\", \"pre-yolk-sac\", \"non-point-source pollution\"). The spelling of compound words can be tricky; authors should consult the dictionary or the principles given in the guidelines. Compounds that serve as nouns are usually left “open” (i.e., with spaces between the individual words) unless the constituent parts are closely linked or the compounds are generally recognized. Compounds that serve as adjectives are treated in various ways, depending on the particular form and its position in the sentence. Compounds consisting of a noun and a present or past participle are hyphenated (e.g., \"decision-making authority\", \"oxygen-depleted waters\"). Compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun are hyphenated unless the open form is very familiar (e.g., \"main-stem reaches\", \"second-order stream\", \"cost-effective measures\"). Compounds containing an adverb that ends in “-ly” are never hyphenated (e.g., \"rapidly changing situation\"). With the exceptions noted in the guidelines, compounds containing other adverbs are hyphenated (e.g., \"well-written article\", \"much-replicated research\"). Compounds containing units of measure are hyphenated (e.g., \"1.5-mg/L treatment\"). In AFS publications, en dashes are generally used instead of hyphens in compounds in which the en dash stands for “and,” “to,” or “at” (e.g., \"Beverton Holt analysis\", \"length weight ratio\", \"University of California Davis\"). This chapter explains the treatment of certain symbols and other technical designations that are commonly used in fisheries science. Symbols pertaining to mathematics and statistics are covered in other sections; see also the list of abbreviations and acronyms in the guidelines. "
